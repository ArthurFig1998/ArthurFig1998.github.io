                        The prophet Brigham Young declared, "I have Zion in my view constantly. We are not going to wait for angels, or for Enoch
                        and his company to come and build up Zion, but we are going to build it" ("Building Up and Adornment of Zion By the
                        Saints", Journal of Discourses, Volume 9(56), pp. 282-285).

                <p><strong>Discuss:</strong> Select one of the three options below to lead students in a group discussion.

                                basic wooden blocks, marshmallows & toothpicks, etc.). Have 
                                them compete in a timed race to see which group can build 
                                the tallest structure without it collapsing.
